            Just like terrestrial animals, the creatures of the sea face myriad threats to their survival, both anthropogenic and natural, and many are in trouble. Our oceans appear vast and teeming with life, and until recently, were routinely viewed as containing infinite resources. In actuality, many marine species are decreasing at an alarming rate and are considered endangered.

               <h3>
                All manner of marine species are affected, including cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), seabirds, sea turtles, sharks and other fish, and marine invertebrates. The consequences of loss of species in the marine environment are significant, both ecologically and economically.
                Threats to marine species are varied and—given the nature of the marine environment, with its great expanses and depths—often difficult to see, difficult to measure, and difficult to address. Principal anthropogenic threats to the survival of marine species include fisheries interactions (entanglement in nets and lines).
                A repeat of past failures is unacceptable. Until commitments are fulfilled and it is demonstrated—by an independent party—that vaquita habitat in the Upper Gulf of California is gillnet free, illegal fishing is ended.

                The primary threat facing this shy, small animal is entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets set to catch shrimp, sharks, and other finfish. There has been a recent resurgence in illegal gillnet fishing for critically endangered totoaba, a large schooling marine fish in the drum or croaker family that is also found only in the Gulf of California. Totoaba can grow up to six feet in length and weigh 220 lbs. Although totoaba fishing has been banned in Mexico since 1975, a black market exists for their swim bladders, which are used to make soup and unproven traditional medicine treatments. With a single bladder fetching up to US$14,000, some fishers illegally catch totoaba and traffic them to China and other Asian countries.

                    The difficulty of obtaining a clean, accurate strike or because of inadequately powered weapons, some whales can take minutes, sometimes even hours, to die, especially in ASW hunts. The IWC defines “humane killing” as death brought about “without pain, stress or distress perceptible to the animal. That is the ideal. Any humane killing technique aims first to render an animal insensitive to pain as swiftly as is technically possible, which in practice cannot be instantaneous in the scientific sense.” A significant problem though, is determining whether a struck whale is dead, conscious but paralyzed, or unconscious and insensible to pain. The IWC has spent decades trying to agree to criteria for determining the onset of death or irreversible insensibility. The current criteria, which the IWC agrees are inadequate.

        <h2><b>What are some factors contributing to the extinction of marine species?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Marine species face a multitude of threats contributing to their extinction. Habitat destruction, primarily from coastal development, dredging, and coral reef degradation, reduces available habitats and disrupts crucial breeding and feeding grounds. Overfishing, driven by the demand for seafood, has led to the collapse of numerous fish populations, disrupting marine food webs and ecosystems.

        </p>
        <h2><b>Why are coral reefs important, and what threats do they face?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Coral reefs are vital marine ecosystems that support extraordinary biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. They protect coastlines from erosion and storm damage, support fisheries by providing habitats and nurseries for fish species, and contribute to global nutrient cycling. However, coral reefs face numerous threats, primarily from human activities.

        </p>
        <h2><b>What are the main threats to marine turtles, and how do these impact their populations?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Marine turtles face numerous threats throughout their life cycle, contributing to population declines and endangerment. Habitat loss and degradation, primarily from coastal development, disrupt nesting sites and foraging habitats, reducing the availability of suitable areas for nesting and feeding. Pollution, including plastic debris, chemical pollutants, and oil spills, poses significant risks to marine turtles through ingestion, entanglement, and habitat contamination, leading to injury, illness, and death. Bycatch in fishing gear, such as trawls, longlines, and gillnets, results in accidental capture and drowning of marine turtles.

        <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this tricky yet pervasive issue?  
            There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward according to many. 
            What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away.  </p>
