            Humans are killing sharks at a much faster rate than sharks can repopulate. Sharks mature slowly, have slow reproductive rates, and produce few offspring—all of which makes them extremely vulnerable to extinction. Over one quarter of all known shark species are considered threatened or endangered. Sharks are apex predators in many ecosystems, and their disappearance  is causing dangerous imbalances in marine communities worldwide. Without sharks, the health and productivity of our oceans—and dependent livelihoods and economies—are at risk.

                Many shark populations have faced steep declines due to years of exploitation for their fins, cartilage, meat, and liver oil. There is a robust global market for shark fins in particular to meet the demand for shark fin soup. Shark fin soup is a popular (and pricey) dish in some East Asian societies, prized as a symbol of prosperity. It is traditionally served at banquets and on special occasions such as weddings. Continued demand for shark fin soup, dumplings, and other shark fin dishes served in restaurants around the world perpetuates the practice of finning, resulting in an estimated 73 million sharks being killed each year for their fins alone.

                Because of the high commercial value of shark fins and the relatively low value of shark meat, fishers often take only the fins and leave the rest of the body behind—an extremely cruel and wasteful practice. Typically, sharks are finned alive—brought aboard fishing vessels to have their fins sliced off, then thrown back into the sea, where they suffocate, bleed to death, or are eaten by other animals. Appallingly, the animals are usually conscious through much of the ordeal.Approximately 50 million more sharks die annually as bycatch in unregulated fisheries, often through the use of destructive and indiscriminate fishing methods such as longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The international shark fin trade is largely unregulated, so sharks caught accidentally are routinely killed for their fins.

                    The difficulty of obtaining a clean, accurate strike or because of inadequately powered weapons, some whales can take minutes, sometimes even hours, to die, especially in ASW hunts. The IWC defines “humane killing” as death brought about “without pain, stress or distress perceptible to the animal. That is the ideal. Any humane killing technique aims first to render an animal insensitive to pain as swiftly as is technically possible, which in practice cannot be instantaneous in the scientific sense.” A significant problem though, is determining whether a struck whale is dead, conscious but paralyzed, or unconscious and insensible to pain. The IWC has spent decades trying to agree to criteria for determining the onset of death or irreversible insensibility.

        <h2><b>What is shark finning, and why is it a controversial practice?<b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Shark finning is the process of removing a shark's fins while at sea and discarding the rest of the shark back into the water, often still alive. It is controversial because of its wastefulness and the severe impact it has on shark populations and marine ecosystems.

        </p>
        <h2><b>What are the main reasons behind the practice of shark finning?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Shark fins are highly valued in some cultures for use in shark fin soup, a delicacy considered a status symbol. The demand for shark fins drives the practice of finning, as the fins fetch high prices in international markets.

        </p>
        <h2><b>How does shark finning affect shark populations and marine ecosystems?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Shark finning leads to the depletion of shark populations, as sharks are often targeted solely for their fins and not for their meat. This disrupts marine food webs and can have cascading effects on the health and balance of marine ecosystems.

        <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this tricky yet pervasive issue?  
            There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward according to many. 
            What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away.  </p>
