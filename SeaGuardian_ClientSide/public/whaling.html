        <p><h2>Whales, dolphins, and porpoises are categorized taxonomically in the order Cetacea. As mammals they are warnm blooded.
            There are over 80 extant species of cetaceans, categorized into two suborders: the toothed whales (odontocetes) and baleen whales (mysticetes).

                <h3>The hunting and killing of cetaceans by humans is termed "whaling" and is practiced on both odontocetes and mysticetes by several countries. Although whaling historically was for oil (rendered from whale fat or blubber) and spermaceti (from the head cavity of sperm whales used to make candles and cosmetics and as a fine lubricant), cetaceans are mainly hunted and killed today for food in both commercial (for profit) whaling operations and by indigenous peoples hunting for nutritional and cultural subsistence (known as Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling (ASW)).
                    Cetaceans are also killed in a misguided effort to reduce competition for fish and several small cetaceans (small whale, dolphin, and porpoise species) are hunted for use as bait to catch fish.

                Generally, whaling can be split into two types—whaling on the great whales and the hunting of small cetaceans in coastal waters, such as the infamous drive hunts in Japan and the Faroe Islands. Since 1946, whaling on the great whales has, for the most part, been regulated by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) pursuant to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW). While the ICRW includes definitions of some odontocetes and includes references to toothed whales in its schedule (the binding rules and definitions that implement the ICRW), the IWC has concentrated its management on the great whales, setting quotas and other restrictions on hunting. The IWC’s Scientific Committee, however, routinely works on conservation issues relating to all cetaceans.

                    The difficulty of obtaining a clean, accurate strike or because of inadequately powered weapons, some whales can take minutes, sometimes even hours, to die, especially in ASW hunts. The IWC defines “humane killing” as death brought about “without pain, stress or distress perceptible to the animal. That is the ideal. Any humane killing technique aims first to render an animal insensitive to pain as swiftly as is technically possible, which in practice cannot be instantaneous in the scientific sense.” A significant problem though, is determining whether a struck whale is dead, conscious but paralyzed, or unconscious and insensible to pain. The IWC has spent decades trying to agree to criteria for determining the onset of death or irreversible insensibility. The current criteria, which the IWC agrees are inadequate.

        <h2><b>How does whaling affect the delicate balance of marine ecosystems?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Whales play a crucial role in marine ecosystems as apex predators and nutrient recyclers. Their removal disrupts food chains and can lead to imbalances in populations of other marine species.

        <h2><b>What are the long-term consequences of reducing whale populations through whaling?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Long-term consequences include decreased biodiversity, altered marine habitats, and potential cascading effects on fisheries and global ocean health.
            By supporting international agreements such as the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and advocating for stronger enforcement mechanisms, governments can work together to combat illegal whaling activities.

        <h2><b>How does the loss of whales impact the health of our oceans?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Whales contribute to nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and the regulation of plankton populations. Their absence can disrupt these processes, affecting the overall health and functioning of marine ecosystems.

        <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this tricky yet pervasive issue?  
            There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward according to many. 
            What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away.  </p>
