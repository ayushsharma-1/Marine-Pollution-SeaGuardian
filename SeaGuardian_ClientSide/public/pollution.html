            Where once people thought waste could be dumped and absorbed by the seas with little lasting effect (“the solution to pollution is dilution” was one slogan), we now know that is not the case. As testament to this, one only has to observe the New Jersey-sized dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico—where agrichemicals washed in from the Mississippi River spawn algal blooms that choke off most marine life; or the massive Eastern and Western Pacific garbage patches.

                Physical contaminants such as plastic, agrichemicals, and oil aren’t the only form of pollution, however. Pollution can also include non-physical contaminants, such as noise. In large bodies of water, sound waves can carry with little attenuation (reduction) for miles. Sources of anthropogenic (human-generated) ocean noise include the use of explosives, oceanographic experiments, underwater construction, ship traffic, military active sonar, and airguns used for oil and gas exploration, drilling and shipping activities.

Such noise levels are increasing at an alarming rate, with some areas seeing a doubling of levels every decade for the past 60 years

                Common man-made physical pollutants that reach the ocean include pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, detergents, oil, sewage, plastics, discarded fishing gear and other solid debris. Often, they are released far upstream. Many of these pollutants collect at the ocean's depths, where they are consumed by small marine organisms and introduced into the global food chain.

                Solid waste like bags, foam, and other items dumped into the oceans from land or by ships at sea are frequently mistaken for prey and consumed by marine mammals, fish, and birds, often with fatal effects.

                    The difficulty of obtaining a clean, accurate strike or because of inadequately powered weapons, some whales can take minutes, sometimes even hours, to die, especially in ASW hunts. The IWC defines “humane killing” as death brought about “without pain, stress or distress perceptible to the animal. That is the ideal. Any humane killing technique aims first to render an animal insensitive to pain as swiftly as is technically possible, which in practice cannot be instantaneous in the scientific sense.” A significant problem though, is determining whether a struck whale is dead, conscious but paralyzed, or unconscious and insensible to pain. The IWC has spent decades trying to agree to criteria for determining the onset of death or irreversible insensibility.

        <h2><b>What are the main sources of marine pollution, and how do they impact marine ecosystems?<b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Marine pollution originates from various sources, including land-based activities (such as industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and urban sewage), marine transportation (such as oil spills and ship waste), offshore oil and gas extraction, and marine debris (such as plastics, microplastics, and abandoned fishing gear). 
        </p>
        <h2><b>How does plastic pollution affect marine life, and what are the long-term consequences for marine ecosystems?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine life, as marine animals can ingest plastic debris or become entangled in it, leading to injury, suffocation, starvation, and death. Additionally, plastics can leach harmful chemicals into the water, affecting the health of marine organisms and ecosystems. Over time, plastic pollution can accumulate in the environment, persisting for decades or even centuries, and causing widespread harm to marine biodiversity and habitats.
        </p>
        <h2><b>What are the effects of oil spills on marine ecosystems, and how do they impact coastal communities?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Oil spills can have devastating effects on marine ecosystems, as spilled oil can coat the surfaces of water, shorelines, and marine organisms, leading to smothering, poisoning, and habitat destruction. Oil spills can also contaminate water supplies, harm fisheries and aquaculture, disrupt coastal economies dependent on tourism and recreation, and pose health risks to coastal communities exposed to oil-related pollutants.

        <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this tricky yet pervasive issue?  
            There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward according to many. 
            What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away.  </p>
