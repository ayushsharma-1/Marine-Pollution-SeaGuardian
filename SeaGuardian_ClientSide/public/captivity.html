            Whales and dolphins are complex social animals and are not well suited for a life in captivity. When confined, they are prevented from carrying out natural behaviors, which include roaming up to 100 miles per day, hunting live prey, and interacting with their pod mates—who also suffer when pod members are removed.

            When forced to interact with humans in a captive situation they have been known to behave aggressively.

               <h3>
                The tradition of housing cetaceans in captivity began over 100 years ago in the 1860s, when circus mogul P.T. Barnum paid for the capture of two beluga whales off the Labrador coast and transported them to New York. These belugas and later others were housed in Barnum’s American Museum. In the 1870s, many dolphins and belugas were captured for display in aquariums in Europe and the United States, with few surviving very long.

                In fact, Barnum played up the likelihood of belugas dying quickly to motivate the public to visit his exhibits! In July 1865 he wrote in the New York Herald that “NOW IS THE TIME to see these wonders as THEIR LIVES ARE UNCERTAIN, seven of the same species having died while being exhibited at this Museum.

                In 1938, at Florida’s Marine Studios, Cecil M. Walker discovered it was possible to train bottlenose dolphins—thus increasing the popularity of dolphins in captivity. But the real boost for those displaying captive cetaceans came in the early 1960s, with the release of the movie and TV series “Flipper.” Growing demand for dolphins soon fueled the capture and trade of thousands of cetaceans.
                The cetaceans most commonly held in captivity for human entertainment are orcas, beluga whales, bottlenose dolphins and Pacific white-sided dolphins.

                <h3>
                    Though tanks are bigger and cetaceans in captivity are less callously treated than in P.T. Barnum's day, the fact remains that captivity for these active, social, intelligent animals is still inappropriate. In recent years, more people have become aware of the ethical and philosophical arguments against cetacean captivity and in some places the popularity of dolphin shows has dwindled. In addition, the science is growing that cetaceans, especially orcas, adapt poorly to confinement. Sadly, many captive facilities still exist, and while they are in decline in the developed world, more are being built in developing countries, and these intelligent animals continue to be bred in captivity and wrenched from the wild for captive display.

        <h2><b>What is marine animal confinement, and what are the primary methods used for confining marine animals?<b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Marine animal confinement refers to the practice of keeping marine animals in captivity, often for purposes such as entertainment, research, or commercial exploitation. Primary methods of confinement include aquariums, marine parks, sea cages, and captive breeding facilities. 
        </p>
        <h2><b>What are some of the ethical considerations surrounding the confinement of marine animals?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Ethical concerns related to marine animal confinement include issues such as animal welfare, stress, confinement-related health problems, social disruption, loss of natural behaviors, and the morality of using animals for human entertainment or profit.
        </p>
        <h2><b>What are the potential negative impacts of marine animal confinement on individual animals and populations?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Negative impacts of marine animal confinement can include stress-related health issues, reduced lifespan, abnormal behaviors, increased susceptibility to disease, reduced reproductive success, and diminished genetic diversity in captive populations. In some cases, confinement may also contribute to negative public perceptions of marine animals and their conservation status.

        <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this tricky yet pervasive issue?  
            There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward according to many. 
            What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away.  </p>
