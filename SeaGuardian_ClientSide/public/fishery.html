                Modern technologies in fishing practices—including bigger nets, longer lines, and larger fleets, coupled with inadequate oversight of fishing operations by many nations—have contributed to the depletion of the world’s oceans and changed the landscape and balance of the marine environment so drastically that many species now face extinction.

                Unsustainable fishing not only threatens the future survival of targeted marine species, but reverberates throughout the marine ecosystem. In 2006, the journal Science reported that the world's fisheries could collapse by as early as 2048 if current fishing and lax oversight practices continue. This could spell disaster for marine life and the many coastal communities that depend on the marine environment for survival.

                <h3>
                    To meet increased demand, humankind has turned to farming fish within artificial enclosures. Far from being a solution to overfishing, however, the methods used in industrial aquaculture are environmentally destructive—adding to rather than easing the burden on ecosystems. Also, as with industrial agriculture on land, the rearing of fish in close quarters can have severe animal welfare implications.

        <h2><b>What is marine fisheries, and why are they important for global food security and livelihoods?<b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Marine fisheries involve the harvesting of marine organisms such as fish, shellfish, and crustaceans for human consumption, trade, and other purposes. Fisheries provide a significant source of protein, essential nutrients, and income for millions of people worldwide, particularly in coastal communities and developing countries.
        </p>
        <h2><b>What are some common fishing methods used in marine fisheries, and how do they impact marine ecosystems?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Common fishing methods include trawling, longlining, purse seining, gillnetting, and pot/trap fishing. Each method has varying levels of environmental impact, such as habitat destruction, bycatch of non-target species, and overfishing of target species, which can disrupt marine food webs and ecosystems.

        </p>
        <h2><b>What are some strategies for promoting sustainable fisheries management and conservation?</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Sustainable fisheries management strategies include implementing science-based quotas and catch limits, regulating fishing gear and methods to minimize bycatch and habitat damage, establishing marine protected areas, promoting ecosystem-based management approaches, and fostering international cooperation and agreements for responsible fishing practices.

        <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this tricky yet pervasive issue?  
            There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward according to many. 
            What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away.  </p>
